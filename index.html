          <p>Most of the students put their efforts on academic activities rather than projects. One reason is that most of them are lack of new ideas for projects and lack of guidance by experts. This ends up with graduates with only academic knowledge but no experience with new technologies and ability to adapt to new technologies. This effort improves student's in CSE get to know new technologies and creative ideas from the start of their carreer rather than in industrial training. And I hope if we succeed, this would be an extraordinary invent which hoist our CSE students among others IT graduates.</p>

<a name="-basic-idea" class="anchor" href="#-basic-idea"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>## Basic Idea:</h3>

<p>Department Lecturers/Instructer(Mentors) who are to evaluate student's projects should have a proper way to evaluate projects' progress rather than by weekly reports or milestones. That will help them decide whether students are involved in their projects actively rather than final second efforts. And also measure each student in each team are actively collaborating their project rather than depending on few team mates. It will also allow mentors know whether each team member assigned in projects have equally distributed portion of work. Furthermore, this solution should provide ability to publish regular updates on the project progress and milestones where project mentors can give feedbacks on them if necessary.</p>
