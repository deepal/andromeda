Most of the students put their efforts on academic activities rather than projects. One reason is that most of them are lack of new ideas for projects and lack of guidance by experts. This ends up with graduates with only academic knowledge but no experience with new technologies and ability to adapt to new technologies. This effort improves student's in CSE get to know new technologies and creative ideas from the start of their carreer rather than in industrial training. And I hope if we succeed, this would be an extraordinary invent which hoist our CSE students among others IT graduates.
